# Run
To test encoder: `python src/main.py --file src/example/test_text.txt --probabilities src/example/test_probabilities.txt`

* `file` - path to file with text to encode
* `probabilities` - path to file with symbols probabilities (you can skip specifing it, so probabilities will be autocalculated based on input text)
